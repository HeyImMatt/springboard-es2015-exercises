// Diff between Var and Let
// Var is hoisted. Let is block scoped. Var can be reassigned and redclared. Let can only be reassigned.

// Diff between var and const
// Const cannot be reassigned or redeclared like Var can. Const is block scoped.

// Diff between let and const
// Let can be reassigned whereas Const cannot.

// Hoisting:
// During compiling, functions and variables are lifted to the top of their scope.
